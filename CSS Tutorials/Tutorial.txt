CSS pre-processors are tools that extend the functionality of CSS (Cascading Style Sheets), the language
 used for styling web pages. They introduce features that are not available in regular CSS, such as variables, 
 mixins, nesting, inheritance, functions, and more.

The main purpose of CSS pre-processors is to make CSS code more maintainable, modular, and efficient. They 
allow developers to write cleaner and more organized code by providing features like:

Variables: Allows defining reusable values that can be used throughout the stylesheet. This makes it easier
 to maintain consistency and make global changes.

Nesting: Enables nesting CSS rules within one another, which helps in organizing and structuring styles in 
a hierarchical way, similar to how HTML elements are nested.

Mixins: Allows defining reusable blocks of styles that can be included within other style rules. This 
promotes code reusability and reduces redundancy.

Functions and Operations: Introduce functions and mathematical operations, enabling more dynamic and 
flexible stylesheets.

Importing: Allows splitting CSS code into multiple files and then importing them into a single file,
 which helps in managing large projects and keeping the codebase organized.

Some popular CSS pre-processors include:

Sass (Syntactically Awesome Stylesheets)
LESS (Leaner Style Sheets)
Stylus
These pre-processors must be compiled into regular CSS before being served to web browsers, as browsers do 
not understand their syntax directly. This compilation process can be done using command-line tools, build 
systems like Gulp or Grunt, or through integrated development environments (IDEs) and text editors that 
support pre-processors.
